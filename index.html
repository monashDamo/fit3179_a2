        <h3>Some background information</h3>
        <p>
          Energy in Australia is regulated and controlled by three main bodies.
          These are the Australian Energy Regulator (AER), the Australian Energy
          Market Commission (AEMC) and finally the Australian Energy Market
          Operator (AEMO). The AER is responsible for regulating the wholesale
          energy and gas markets in Australia. The AEMC is responsible for
          creating rule and regulations which are enforced by the AER. And
          finally the AEMO. This is responsible for overseeing various functions
          of the australian gas and energy markets. These can basically be
          summed up to maintaining and overseeing these markets, managing these
          markets, and finally leading the design of the future energy systems
          in all of australia.
          <br /><br />
          Whilst all 3 of these bodies are equally important, we will mostly be
          focusing on the AEMO.
          <br /><br />
          We will also be using MegaWatt (MW) and PetaJoule (PJ) energy
          measurements in this visualization.

          <p class="pieChart-text">
            The graph on the left shows where our energy come from (2). As we
            can see, most of energy is produced through coal (brown and black
            coal). And some of it is imported. But most of it comes from
            non-renewable sources. Only a small percentage of it comes from
            renewable sources, around <strong>2.66%</strong>. All in all, just
            considering 2022-23 australia generated roughly 20,836 PetaJoules
            worth of energy! <br /><br />
            But with that said, how do we actually make the energy we get
            inhouse? Using power plants!

            This "Power Stations over Australia" (3) graph shows the
            distribution of power plants across australia. As you can most of
            the coal plants (click on the legend) are placed on the outskirts of
            australia, as coal is found in rugged terrains in
            <a

              >basins and underground deposits</a
            >. On the other hand, solar farms are
            <a
              href="https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/how-can-you-determine-most-effective-location-cucre"
              >placed</a
            >
            in the middle of australia and near victoria. Wind farms, on the
            other hand are also placed on the
            <a href="https://globalwindatlas.info/en/area/Australia"
              >outskirts as well</a
            >, since it receives good amount of wind. Ofcourse for all of these
            options, these farms also need to be near civilisation as well to
            provide them with electricity.<br /><br />Even though there are
            ample amount of renewable plants, non-renewable plants generate far
            more power. This can be seen on the "Distribution of power plants
            over fuel type" (3) graph. If you adjust the minimum nameplate
            capacity, you will see that many renewable plants will just
            disappear. By 200 capacity (MW), wind and water are the only
            remaining renewable sources. By 500, water is the only one. But the
            best water plant doesn't generate as much power as the best
            non-renewable plant. This being the Eraring Coal Plant which has a
            capacity of 2,880 MW.

        <h2 class="big-margin">2. Where does our energy go?</h2>
        <p>
          As I explained, most of our energy is produced in australia. But once
          it is produced, where does it go? <br /><br />Our energy production
          can basically be summed by as non-renewable, imports and renewable. On
          the other hand, our energy usage can be summed up as being exported,
          used in various industries and also incurring some loss. "Power
          Production in Australia (2022-23)" already showed us how much energy
          is produced. But how does it get used?
        </p>
        <div class="industriesUsage-body display-container">
          <div class="container-left" id="industriesUsage"></div>
          <!--
          <div class="container-right" id="energyExports"></div>-->
        </div>
        <p>
          From the "Consumption of energy (PJ) in various industries" (2), we
          can see that no renewable energy is used in any of these industries.
          Black coal is used primarily to produce electricity. On the other hand
          Diesel is used a lot, mostly in the transport industry, then being
          scattered around Agriculture, Water and Waste, Construction, and more.
          <br /><br />You might be confused as to where "Petrol", "Diesel" even
          come from, since we didn't see them in the first section. Diesel and
          Petrol are simply byproducts of Crude Oil which we did look at before.
          They are actually produced largely in the manufacturing industry,
          through the oil refinement process. All of this energy together comes
          to about 5,467 PJ. However that there something very important we need
          to note, which is that Electricity is basically creating electricity
          to THEN be later used in other industries. This is indicated by the
          electricity also being a fuel source for many industries. Since this
          is not explicitily an industry, we need to remove this. Doing so we
          get some net usage of around 3,863 PJ <br /><br />Earlier we saw said
          that we generated around 18,709 PJ worth of energy? So where is the
          rest going? Its simply being exported. <br /><br />
          Around 15 thousand (PJ) was exported in (2022-23). And of that most of
          what coal, followed by natural gases, and then various other fuels.
          <br /><br />
          You might have noticed that renewable energy doesn't get used much,
          atleast in the various industries. Its mainly used to generate
          electricity, used in manufacturing and residential areas.
          <br /><br />
          But it doesn't see much use, but will this ever change?

      <!-- Section 3 -->
      <div clas="graph-section">
        <h2 class="big-margin">3. Looking to the future</h2>
        <p>
          According to AEMO, Australia plans to transition the NEM network to
          net zero by 25 years. There plan include to drastically increase
          renewable capabilities. This includes increasing battery storage to 49
          GW to 3 GW, increase Wind and Solar plants capacities to 127 GW, and
          stop electricity generation from coal to 0%. So are we on our way to
          meeting this target?
        </p>
        <div id="elecGenByYear"></div>
        <p>
          If we look at this graph (2), we can see that we have made ample
          progress. Whilst most of our energy is still generated by
          non-renewables. This might look grim, but our plan is to turn to
          renewables for electricity for atleast the NEM network by 2050. So are
          we on the right track?
        </p>
        <div id="PowerPlantsCloseData"></div>
        <p>
          If we consider the above graph (1). You might have noticed that a lot
          of power plants are planned to get shut down, and most of those
          actually include renewables. That may seem a bit counterintuitive, but
          that is simply because this factors in the lifespan of these plants,
          these being

          >,
          <a href="https://windexchange.energy.gov/end-of-service-guide">wind</a
          >. The important thing to realize is that so many new renewable plants
          have sprung up quite recently near the 2020s. This sentiment is
          similarily echoed in the "Amount of electricity (PJ) by year" graph
          which shows that we rely on more renewables for our electricity needs
          than ever before. <br /><br />Its also very important to highlight
          that not many non-renewable plants have an expected date listed, but
          that is infact accurate, as the AEMO roadmap simply highlights moving
          to renewables for our electrical needs, not going completely green.
          With that said, the progress we have seen so far is very much
          admirable.
